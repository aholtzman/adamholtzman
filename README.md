## Professional Artist Website
### Portfolio, CV, Curation details and Book Design by Adam Holtzman

This is the most current iteration of my online art portfolio that first launched in 2002. For every update (happening approximately every 12 to 18 months) I do a complete rebuild and new design. The earliest versions were created with Adobe GoLive, later with Adobe Muse (from the first beta) and now with this version I wrote it with React, React-Router & Styled-Components. I find that using CSS-in-JS I am able to keep my components semantic and organized.

Plans are being drafted for the next version most likely to be created with the React based static site generator Gatsby.
